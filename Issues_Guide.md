# Beginner's Guide to Creating Issues

This guide will walk you through the process of creating issues for bugs or feature requests on GitHub. Don't worry if you're new to GitHub - we'll cover every step!

## What is an Issue?

An issue on GitHub is like a ticket that tracks bugs, feature requests, or other types of tasks. It's a way to communicate with the project maintainers about problems or ideas.

## Creating a Bug Report

### Step 1: Navigate to the Issues Page
1. Go to our GitHub repository page
2. Click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the page
3. Click the green "New issue" button

### Step 2: Choose the Bug Report Template
1. If you see template options, click on "Bug Report"
2. If you don't see templates, don't worry - just proceed to the next step

### Step 3: Fill Out the Bug Report
Please include:
- **Title**: A short, clear summary of the bug (e.g., "App crashes when clicking the save button")
- **Description**: In the main text area, describe the bug with these details:
  - What you were trying to do
  - What happened instead
  - Steps to reproduce the problem (numbered list works best)
  - What you expected to happen
  - Screenshots (if possible)
  - Your system information (operating system, browser version, etc.)

### Step 4: Submit the Issue
1. Review what you've written
2. Click the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom

## Creating a Feature Request

### Step 1: Navigate to the Issues Page
1. Go to our GitHub repository page
2. Click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the page
3. Click the green "New issue" button

### Step 2: Choose the Feature Request Template
1. If you see template options, click on "Feature Request"
2. If you don't see templates, just proceed to the next step

### Step 3: Fill Out the Feature Request
Please include:
- **Title**: A clear summary of the feature you want (e.g., "Add dark mode option")
- **Description**: In the main text area, describe your idea with these details:
  - What problem would this feature solve?
  - Describe the solution you'd like
  - Any alternatives you've considered
  - Screenshots or sketches (if possible)

### Step 4: Submit the Feature Request
1. Review what you've written
2. Click the green "Submit new issue" button at the bottom

## After Submitting an Issue

1. You may receive follow-up questions from maintainers in the comments
2. Check your email or return to the issue periodically to respond
3. Be patient - project maintainers are often volunteers with limited time

## Helpful Tips

- **Search First**: Before creating a new issue, search to make sure someone hasn't already reported the same bug or requested the same feature
- **Be Specific**: The more details you provide, the easier it is for maintainers to understand and address your issue
- **Be Respectful**: Remember that open source projects are often maintained by volunteers
- **Labels**: Don't worry about adding labels - the project maintainers will do this
